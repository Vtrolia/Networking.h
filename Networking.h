//  Hey Kids! Have you ever wanted to be a, a cool web programmer? With this web socket wrapping header file, it's all as easy as pie! (more like Pie-thon!     //
//  yeah, I know I suck) Basically this is a library designed to make creating and maintaining a server or client and creating the connection. It uses all      //
//  of the standard Unix-style socket commands, but I have a Windows-based library named "Win_Networking.h" if you're on team Microsoft.                        //
//  (that version is cleaner, we can get rid of all those nasty #includes) If I'm smart, it's in the same place as this library. All you have to do once        //
//  you import this library is run either connect_to_server() or connect_to_client() and you're good to go. This library's job is to set up the connection for  //
//  you, as setting up send() and receive() is often very dependant on your specific use case, and I don't want to force you to work around my specific way.    //

//  with your own C programs!                                                                                                                                   //

 * this can be a simple process for those who want to build network based programs.
 * @params domain: This is the domain name of the server you are trying to connect to, obviously a string.
 * @params port: A string representing the port you want to connect to.
 * @returns a special connection wrapper object that holds a socket address and the addrsinfo object of the server you are trying to reach. If <0, there is an error
