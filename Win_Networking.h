//  Hey Kids! Have you ever wanted to be a, a cool web programmer? With this web socket wrapping header file, it's all as easy as pie! (more like Pie-thon!   //
//  yeah, I know I suck) Basically this is a library designed to make creating and maintaining a server or client and creating the connection. This version   //
//  utilizes the winsock library to make Windows networking programs. If you're using a Unix-based system, download the regular 'Networking.h'. This library  //
//  is functionally the same as the other one, it's just that this one is needed to work with the different networking commands that come with Windows.       //
//  All you have to do once you import this library is run either connect_to_server() or connect_to_client() and you're good to go. This library's job is     //
//  to set up the connection for you, as setting up send() and receive() is often very dependant on your specific use case, and I don't want to force you to  //
//  work around my specific way. This software is licensed under Apache 2.0 Open Source License so feel free to use it and make money off of what you make.   //
//  email me at vtrolia@protonmail.com if you have comments, concerns, questions or suggestions. Now go, enjoy this amazing technology of the future called   //
//  the "Internet" with your own C programs! Now with added SSL/TLS functionality utilizing OpenSSL!                                                          //
