//  Hey Kids! Have you ever wanted to be a, a cool web programmer? With this web socket wrapping header file, it's all as easy as pie! (more like Pie-      //
//  thon! yeah, I know I suck) Basically this is a library designed to make creating and maintaining a server or client and creating the connection. It     //
//  uses all of the standard Unix-style socket commands, but I have a Windows-based library named "Win_Networking.h" if you're on team Microsoft.           //
//  (that version is cleaner, we can get rid of all those nasty #includes) If I'm smart, it's in the same place as this library. All you have to do         //
//  once you import this library is run either connect_to_server() or connect_to_client() and you're good to go. This library's job is to set up the        //
//  connection for you, as setting up send() and receive() is often very dependant on your specific use case, and I don't want to force you to work around  //
//  my specific way. This software is licensed under MIT License so feel free to use it and make money off of what you make. email me at                    //
//  vtrolia@protonmail.com if you have comments, concerns, questions or suggestions. Now go, enjoy this amazing technology of the future called the         //
//  Internet" with your own C programs! Now with added SSL support! For this, we use OpenSSL                                                                //
