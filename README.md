# Networking.h
This is a pair of header files that make some of the base level C socket functions much easier to use, including a client side and server side function


All that you need to do to create a connection is run one of two functions:

connect_to_server("domain name")
or
connect_to_client()

And you're off to the races! 
Included are a Linux/Macos version and a Windows version. Let me know what you think and how useful they are to you
